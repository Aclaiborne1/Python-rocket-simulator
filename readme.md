rocsim_new.py is a python program for simulating model rocket ascention.
You must place the datafile rocsim.dat in the same directory
as the rocsim_new.py program.  It is designed to auto-execute,
but depending on how you have set up python to run on your system,
you may need to comment out the first line and run as a python
script via 'python rocsim_new.py'.

The program requires the following additional python modules,
available online (see wiki.python.org/moin/UsefulModules): ast
and pandas.
